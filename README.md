PERSONAL URL: \[e.g website or instagram\]


A home gaming system that helps the aquisition of a second language by making use of the principles of Distributed Design, the Hooked Model of trigger &gt; action &gt; variable rewards &gt; investment ect


It's been designed to be makeable by anyone with access to just a 3D printer and online delivery services!


WHY: short description of why it is needed


About the Game!



How might we use distributed design and multi-device interaction to support second language acquisition.

A project that aims to support the 62% of the British population who can only speak one language in acquiring the foundations of a second language through interaction with technology. The outcome of the project will be a functioning and downloadable video game using the unity engine, a companion mobile app wireframe proposal and downloadable instructions and code to create a working game controller that recognizes the users voice.

> \*\*not part of template\*\*
>
> **New requirements**
>
> Due to the limitations you are now operating under, it will not be possible for you to produce high-fidelity prototypes and display them in an exhibition form.  The 'display' deliverable has been modified to a 'brochure'. You will each be required to produce a pdf brochure for your prototype and upload it here on Wikifactory.
>
> Your brochure is a professional representation of your product to the public and it's tone should be public facing, not be academic. You need to communicate the finished product clearly. It should include:
>
> * POSTER - a cover page succinctly communicating WHO, WHAT, HOW & WHY. This can be as an elevator pitch, or 'how might we'. Include a title for you project, a picture of you, a personal URL \[L6 must do this L5 optional\] A square cropped hero image.
> * PRODUCT - Minimum 6 images including: 1 studio shot/ render of your finished product. 1 context/ in use shot, 4 close details.
> * PROCESS - 1 page 'FlatLay' layout of parts or materials library or tools
> * DISTRIBUTED- 1 page showing it can be made anywhere by anyone with illustrated 'ikea style' assembly instructions.
> * CIRCULAR - 1 page infographic showing why your product is 'good' Demonstrate and explain material origins and product's end of life. Can be PPP, STGS - choose what best comunicates for you.
>
> IMPORTANT:
>
> * **Max size 2mb** use a pdf shrinker or reduce size in adobe.
> * **200 word limit** Use clear language and infographics
> * **10 page max**
> * **Quality** You will be judged on two things, the product itself: materials, desirability, display and it's presentation: photographs, fonts, branding, colours etc.

### 

> \*\*not part of template\*\*
>
> **New requirements**
>
> Due to the limitations you are now operating under, the 'Film' deliverable has been relaxed to allow longer films if needed \(up to 6 minutes\) and some deliverables that would have been served by the display can now be shown in the film.
>
> The following deliverables are a guide and your film does not need to be in this order nor spend equal time on each. \(some may be covered by the same content\) It is up to you to make the film that comunicates your project the best.
>
> * INSIGHTS - Documentation of your 'experience', ethnographic and primary research
> * HACK - Show how you compares alternative methods and techniques through a hack or tear down of an exisiting product.
> * EXPERT - The most relevant excerpt from an Interview with expert or unique user.
> * EXPERIMENT - Video of testing, failing multiple prototypes
> * MAKING - Assembly video of the final product.
> * FUNCTION - Show the product working in context \(or mock up/ stage if not possible\)
> * FEEDBACK - Return to the expert or user and show them your design. Record their comments \(can be online video call\).
>
> IMPORTANT:
>
> * **Max size 20mb/min** Keep film size low, no more that 20mb/min. A 3 min video should be no higher than 60mb at 1080p.
> * **Upload to youtube** and embbed on Wikifactory, write a short description under the embedded film \(or you cannpt save it\)
> * **3-6min** You can make your film up to 6 min long but keep the editing snappy.
> * **Use licensed or free music:** https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/
> * **Quality** You will be judged on editing, audio recording, storytelling, pace - is it 'inspirational'?
>
> TIPS:
>
> * Speed up your footage by 10-20%
> * choose music first then edit to the beat
> * start with your hero shot e.g start with the end.
> * Write a storyboard in pencil to plan it.
> * get someone from your family to watch it - do they get it?
> * Use subtitles all the way through.



































## PORTFOLIO





















































## - About

This section is a written Personal Novel Context, and expanded HMW and elevator pitch \[a repeat of the above about sections but in more detail\]. Level 6 must also "locate a personal position within design contexts."

This image has been resized in photoshop from a 4000px dlsr photo \(actually https://pixlr.com/pro/editor/ \) to be 1500px x 1000px and saved as a jpg at 72dpi. It does not need to be higher than this.

​

こんにちは-Senpai \(Konnichiwa-Senpai\) is a language learning SYSTEM that uses the hooked methodology to build a higher level of commitment towards learning a the Japanese language through a LAYERED and DIY approach that's more involved than spending 5 minutes on a language app and never speaking a word!

​

The system will demand that the user builds their own controller and run a browser-based game. This creates a much more focused and committed environment for language learning that also requires the user to speak the language aloud before progressing; an element of learning that is almost always optional in language apps for learning on the bus – but according to Jo for Brighton Language College –  is one of the most important aspects of learning any modern language.

​

The system brings together a unity-based video game and a homemade controller; built with nothing more than stock and unaltered electronic prototyping components and cardboard covering. Both the game and the instructions for building the controller are hosted on the こんにちは-Senpai website.

​

This system is needed because 62% of the British population only speak English, compared to European countries where 62% of people speak at least 2 languages. 1 in 3 people admit to having tried – and failed – to learn a language. This statistic includes myself; who has tried learn both Japanese and Mandarin Chinese without success.

## **notes on portfolio**



































### 

> \*\*not part of template\*\*
>
> The portfolio is split into 5 parts, please use these headers:

> * ABOUT- this is a written Personal Novel Context, and &lt;u&gt;expanded&lt;/u&gt; HMW and elevator pitch \[a repeat of the above about sections but in more detail\]. Level 6 must also "locate a personal position within design contexts."
> * SPECIFICATION - This is your Step by step written guide \[more detailed instructions than the illustrated one\], Bill of Materials, List of machines and tools used, assembly photos in order and the 'Ready to make' CAD files embedded. Showing “specification requirements for the potential manufacture”
> * DEVELOPMENT - Selected content from the whole project \(e.g film, brochure, portfolio, tech manual\) edited together as an article or diary. Your selected elements create a narrative. Extras can go in the appendix
> * ANALYSIS - Critical relflection and analysis of the project \[a more detailed text based version of the circular page from the brochure\] , user feedback, material tracking, PPP
> * APENDIX - code, transcripts, surveys anything text heavy that is not needed for a narrative but backs up your research. You can put film clips here - only you tube links don't upload them to WF.
> * IMPORTANT:
>   * **Use images over film** edit images into gallery in photoshop and insert as one block. Use more images instead of film clips. You can make put longer films \(if embedded from youtube\) into the appendix.
>   * If you use images that you did not create you MUST credit them. To not do so is plagurism.
>   * **1000 word limit** Excluding the appendix
>   * **Upload CAD** your specification section should be good enough that someone can make your product.
>   * **Quality** You will be judged on narrative and editing - you do not need to graphically design this section.
>
>   TIP: try https://typora.io/ to edit the readme offline
